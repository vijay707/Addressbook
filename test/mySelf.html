		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
			<p>My name is Vijay. I am 19 years old currently 
pursuing BCA from KGCAS. Talking
 about my schooling, I have completed my secondary education 
from KVMHSS in C.SC stream. Now 
coming to my family. I live in a joint family. Being in a joint family I
 got a lot of affection, care and a love from all of my family members 
and they always supports me whenever I feel low. Being an elder child in
 the family I am supposed to be more responsible. Now about my parents, 
My father is a business man and My mother 
 is a housewife and my elder Sister
  is working in TCS.</p>

<h3>NATURE</h3>

<p>Well, talking about my nature, I am not very sure. Sometimes, I am 
very polite, but sometimes I become very aggressive. Sometime I used to 
be very simple and sometimes very fashionable. So, its also not my cup 
of tea to explain my nature. I am very impatient. I am also very shy 
depending upon the type of people whom I meet and it also depend upon 
the situation in which I am in</p>

<h3>LIKES</h3>

<p>Usually one likes those thing in which he/she gets pleasure. But as 
for myself I got pleasure in many small things of my life. Like, I love 
to spend my free time with my family, going on tour with them. I like to
 talk with friends and share my feelings with them which makes me 
please. I also like to do rash driving, racing , going to cinemas, 
shouting or whistling with friends, playing games on mobile and P.C, I 
like to listen music when I am free or when I am feeling bore. I can 
proudly say that music is my best friend which keep my mood fresh and 
brings happiness in my life. These are the only few things which I like 
or in which I gets pleasure, but there are many. I am a person who finds
 happiness in every minor things.</p>

<h3>DISLIKES</h3>

<p>Yes, I agree that I find happiness in every small things but still 
there are some things which I hate or which I don’t like. Among many 
categories of people I hate those people who used to talk bad things 
about someone behind his/her back; I hate people who cries for small 
things; I hate negative people and the people who are fake, narrow 
minded and devoid of warmth feeling and sincerity which are surely not 
likeable to me. I don’t like to go at crowdy places as it makes me 
mentally sick, I don’t like to wake up early for work. Also, I don’t 
like</p>
